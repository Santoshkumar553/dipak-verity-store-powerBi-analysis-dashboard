Yearly Profit Overview: Visualize year-over-year profit growth to help businesses gauge their financial performance across multiple years.   3. Purchase Insights: Monitor monthly and yearly purchase quantities to maintain an optimal inventory balance.   4. Average Order Value (AOV): Calculate and compare AOV on a month-to-month and year-to-year basis, ensuring alignment with business goals.   5. State-Wise Performance: Deep-dive into state-wise sales and profit metrics to uncover regional trends and drive location-specific marketing strategies.   6. Top Buyers: Identify the top 5 customers who have made the highest purchases over the years, helping tailor personalized marketing and loyalty programs.   7. Product Recommendation System: Use quantity trends to recommend products that may need replenishment or increased inventory in the future.    This project was built using Power BI, a powerful analytics tool that helped in integrating, modeling, and visualizing the data effectively. The clean and intuitive dashboard ensures user-friendly navigation and delivers insights at a glance.    By employing such detailed data analysis and visualization, businesses can make data-driven decisions to improve their customer service, maximize profits, and enhance overall operational efficiency.
